## Adobe Premiere Scripts

Transpile w TypeScript, use debuggers and other stuff.

### Workflow

1. From VSCode, run `Terminal > Run Build Task` and choose `watch`; this starts the TypeScript tranpsiler.
2. Make edits to `index.ts` -- this will transpile to `index.js`
3. Use the `Start index.js` build script to run the script (and debug). You may need to cmd-tab to Premiere to "kick" the script to start.
